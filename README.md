# Predicting Students at Risk Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques in MOOC Online Courses 

Abstract - 
Educational Data Mining(EDM) is a new growing research area since 2007, where the essence of data mining concepts are used in the educational field for interpreting and extracting useful information of the student’s in the learning process. As this field of study is related to academic performance,  it is necessary for universities to develop a predictive model to identify the potential risk of a student getting failed or a student getting withdrawn from the course which is also called student attrition. EDM methods are often different as it has a multilevel hierarchy and non-independence factors in educational data. In this connection, the purpose of this study is to predict and compare the result of students based on their academic performance using different models.

The objective of this study was broken down into two parts:
•	What are the important features for classifying students who are at risk?
•	How can you predict future outcomes for students who are at risk?
•	What are the different models that can be used for analysing VLE interaction of students in courses
